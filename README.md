# Tick Tock Tech Clock

## About
Tick Tock Tech Clock is a web-based clock application that displays the time using the traditional clock face with hour, minute, and second hands. The clock hands move in real-time to reflect the current time, and users have the option to turn on/off the ticking sound effect. This project was built using plain CSS and JavaScript.

PS: After being inspired by Wes Bos' JAVASCRIPT30 course, I decided to follow it and build the Tick Tock Tech Clock application to keep my hands dirty with JavaScript.
